### Week 7 Objectives

* Review core AWS architecture principles to prepare for the assessment/exam.  
* Strengthen understanding of security, resilience, performance, and cost optimization best practices.  
* Consolidate knowledge from previous weeks across networking, compute, storage, and security services.

### Tasks Completed This Week

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference |
|-----|------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Mon** | Reviewed the **AWS Well-Architected Framework**, focusing on all six pillars and how they relate to real-world architectures.<br>Mapped key AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, VPC, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudFront) to the relevant pillars. | 27/10/2025 | 27/10/2025 | — |
| **Tue** | Studied **secure architecture design**: IAM roles/policies, MFA, SCP, KMS encryption, ACM/TLS, Security Groups vs NACLs, WAF, Shield, GuardDuty, Secrets Manager. | 28/10/2025 | 28/10/2025 | — |
| **Wed** | Reviewed **resilient architecture** concepts: Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region, RDS Multi-AZ, Auto Scaling, load balancing, Route 53 health checks, AWS Backup, DR strategies (backup & restore, pilot light, warm standby, multi-site). | 29/10/2025 | 29/10/2025 | — |
| **Thu** | Studied **high-performance & cost-optimized architectures**: compute scaling patterns (Auto Scaling, Lambda, Fargate), storage choices (S3/EFS/EBS), caching, and AWS cost-management tools (Budgets, Cost Explorer, Savings Plans, lifecycle policies, storage tiering). | 30/10/2025 | 30/10/2025 | — |
| **Fri** | Attended the exam session and completed the required assessment for the module. | 31/10/2025 | 31/10/2025 | — |

### Week 7 Achievements

* Gained a strong understanding of the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** and how each pillar applies to designing modern cloud systems.
* Improved knowledge of **security best practices**, including IAM hardening, encryption, network protection layers, and monitoring.
* Strengthened understanding of **resiliency and high availability**, especially Multi-AZ/Multi-Region strategies and DR patterns.
* Reviewed **compute and storage performance optimization**, scaling techniques, and ways to reduce latency and improve throughput.
* Understood how to optimize cost using the right tools and pricing models: Savings Plans, RI, lifecycle rules, S3 storage classes, NAT optimization.
* Completed the end-of-week assessment/exam with improved confidence in AWS architectural principles.
