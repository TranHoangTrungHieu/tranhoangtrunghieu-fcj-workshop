### Tasks Completed

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference |
|-----|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Mon** | - Reviewed core networking concepts in Amazon VPC: VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, IGW, NAT Gateway, Security Groups, and NACLs.<br>- Understood how these components interact to form a secure, isolated cloud network. | 15/09/2025 | 15/09/2025 | https://000003.awsstudygroup.com |
| **Tue** | - Practiced building a custom VPC from scratch: created a VPC, one public subnet, one private subnet, and attached an Internet Gateway.<br>- Configured route tables and documented CIDR blocks, AZs, and routing rules for later labs. | 16/09/2025 | 16/09/2025 | AWS Study Group + YouTube Tutorial |
| **Wed** | - Studied Amazon EC2 fundamentals: instance types, AMIs, EBS volumes, pricing, Security Groups, and key pairs.<br>- Prepared a deployment plan (AMI + instance type + subnet + SG) for the upcoming web server lab. | 17/09/2025 | 17/09/2025 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAR6QRT3N1k |
| **Thu** | - Participated in an AWS event to gain insight into real-world cloud use cases and best practices. | 18/09/2025 | 18/09/2025 | — |
| **Fri** | - Added and configured an additional EBS volume for an EC2 instance (create → attach → format → mount).<br>- Wrote internal documentation titled **“VPC + EC2 Lab – Week 2”**, summarizing architecture, setup steps, and key security considerations. | 19/09/2025 | 19/09/2025 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NjNTnXon5s |

### Week 2 Achievements

* Gained a solid understanding of AWS Networking concepts and how VPC components work together to build isolated environments.
* Successfully created a custom VPC with both public and private subnets, including routing configuration.
* Learned how to choose appropriate AMIs and instance types when deploying EC2 workloads.
* Became confident in launching EC2 instances and configuring Security Groups and key pairs.
* Attached and mounted additional EBS volumes, understanding storage expansion techniques for EC2.
* Documented a full lab workflow (VPC + EC2) with architecture diagrams, CIDR planning, and security notes.
* Strengthened hands-on skills with both AWS Console and CLI for managing Compute and Networking resources.
