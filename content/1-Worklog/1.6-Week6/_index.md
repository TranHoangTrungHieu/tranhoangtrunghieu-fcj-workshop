### Week 6 Achievements

* Gained a solid understanding of **S3 Access Points** and why they are effective for multi-tenant or large shared-data environments.  
* Learned how to choose the right **S3 Storage Class** to optimize cost according to access patterns.  
* Learned how to configure **S3 Static Website Hosting**, including correct CORS configuration to avoid frontend access issues.  
* Understood the differences between **ACLs, IAM Policies, and Bucket Policies**, and when each should be used.  
* Learned best practices for **object key design** to improve performance and reduce retrieval costs.  
* Practiced enabling **S3 Versioning** and restoring previous versions after accidental deletion or overwrite.  
* Gained a clear understanding of **S3 Glacier** archival tiers and retrieval workflows.  
* Strengthened practical skills in S3 management to prepare for upcoming modules on CloudFront, Route 53, and content delivery architectures.
